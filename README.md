# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## What is Tic-tac-toe?

Tic-tac-toe is a board game of two players, each player taking turn in marking the spaces in a 3 X 3 grid. There is a win, if a player succeeds in placing their three marks in a horizontal, or vertical or diagonal direction along the grid.    

## Rules of the game:

- Either of the player can chose a symbol "X" or "O"
- When a player marks a space on the grid, the second player is not allowed to mark on the same space.
- There is a win if a player marks a complete row, column or diagonal.
- There is a tie, if there is no space left on the grid, without any win, from both players.
